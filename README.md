#Ariadne - A framework for Codekit

This is designed to be combiation of both [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [bourbon](http://bourbon.io). 

Why when you can easily use both. Twitter bootstrap is great but is designed to be used with a lot of extra classes floating about our markup -- I am aware that you can easily avoid this but I am talking common usage. This is designed more as a mixin library for common values to keep our class names clean and is built on the philosophy if you write some specific code more than once it belongs in a framework while keeping our output css clean. 

If you want to contribute then that is great submit a pull request and I will look at it. (It is quite likely that I will accept it if you follow graceful downgrade principle and work towards modern markup[Buzzwords include HTML5 and CSS3])
