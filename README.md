#Ariadne - A framework for Codekit

Let's face it Codekit is awesome and it has a really power tool set all on its own without having us to learn to trim a neckbeard and yet we ignoring one of its more powerful features - Javascript Import from frameworks. 

I plan on making Ariadne something like [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) for Codekit. 

Features it currently has. 
* [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) with a couple of additions and changes.

Features in the works
* Common Javascript Libraries using submodules
* Rake update and easy curl installation
